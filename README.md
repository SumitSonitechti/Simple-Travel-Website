## Project Title: Simple Travel Website

---

### About This Project

Hello everyone! üëã This is my first proper **HTML assignment** for my B.Tech 1st Year course, given by Mayank Lakhotia Sir.

I was tasked with using all the fundamental HTML tags we've learned to create a simple, fun travel website. This project includes **two linked HTML files** to show basic navigation between pages. I tried my best to structure it neatly!

### What's Included (A Deep Dive into the Code! ü§ì)

This project contains two key HTML files:

1.  **`SumitSoni202501100400329.html` (The Main Homepage)**
    This file contains the main website content, demonstrating various structural and formatting elements:

    * **Structure:** Uses the correct HTML5 document type, $\text{<head>}$ for metadata, and $\text{<body>}$ for visible content. Headings ($\text{<h1>}$ and $\text{<h2>}$) are used to create a clear content hierarchy.
    * **Formatting Tags:** I used all the basic inline tags to format the paragraphs:
        * $\text{<b>}$ (Bold)
        * $\text{<i>}$ (Italic)
        * $\text{<u>}$ (Underline)
        * $\text{<s>}$ (Strikethrough)
    * **Images ($\text{<img>}$):** I added my favourite destinations (Goa and Shimla) and activities. *Please Note: Two of the image paths are **relative** ($\text{src="/HTML assignment/..."}$). They will only load correctly if the original folder structure is preserved on your computer.*
    * **Hyperlinks ($\text{<a>}$):** Used to link to external websites ($\text{target="_blank"}$ is used to open MakeMyTrip in a new tab) and to link internally to my contact page.
    * **Lists:** I included examples of all three main list types:
        * **Ordered List ($\text{<ol>}$):** For **Top Destinations** (numbered list).
        * **Unordered List ($\text{<ul>}$):** For **Travel Essentials** (bullet list).
        * **Definition List ($\text{<dl>}$):** Used for **Travel Meanings** (Terms $\text{<dt>}$ and Definitions $\text{<dd>}$).
    * **Table ($\text{<table>}$):** A simple package cost table. I used the old-school $\text{border="1"}$ attribute to make the grid visible.

2.  **`Contact Us .html` (The Linked Page)**
    This is a very simple page that has a link back to the main homepage. Its purpose is purely to demonstrate successful **internal hyperlink navigation** between two different HTML documents within the same project.

### How to Run This Project Properly on GitHub üíª

This is a simple, client-side project, so it's super easy to run!

1.  **Clone or Download:** Get all the files onto your machine.
2.  **File Location:** Make sure both $\text{SumitSoni202501100400329.html}$ and $\text{Contact Us .html}$ are located inside the $\text{/HTML assignment/}$ folder, as my links use that path.
3.  **Launch:** Simply **double-click** the main file: **`SumitSoni202501100400329.html`**
4.  It will open immediately in your default web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.). You can then click the links to test the internal navigation and external websites.

Thanks for checking out my first major web assignment! Any feedback is welcome! üôè
