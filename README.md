### Project Title: Travel With Me!

### About This Project

Hello! 👋 This is my first proper HTML assignment for my B.Tech course, given by Mayank Lakhotia Sir.

I've tried to use all the main HTML tags we learned to make a simple, fun travel website. It's just one main page with one link to a contact page.

### What is included (What I learned! 😎)

This project has two HTML files and uses lots of basic tags:

1.  **`SumitSoni202501100400329.html` (The Main Page)**
    * **Headings (<h1>, <h2>):** For the title and sections.
    * **Formatting Tags (<strong>or <b>, <em>, <ins> or <u>, <s>):** To make the travel paragraphs look interesting.
    * **Images (<img>):** I added my favourite destinations (Goa and Shimla) and activities. *Note: Some image paths might only work on my computer.*
    * **Hyperlinks (<a>):** Links to MakeMyTrip and my contact page.
    * **Lists:** I used all three types!
        * Ordered List (<ol>) for **Top Destinations**.
        * Unordered List (<ul>) for **Travel Essentials**.
        * Definition List (<dl>) for **Travel Meanings** (Tourist, Guide, Itinerary).
    * **Table (<table>):** A simple table with my package costs (border="1" used).
2.  **`Contact Us .html` (The Linked Page)**
    * A very small page to practice linking between different HTML documents.
